# number-theory-functions-interface
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
This project unifies four widely used number theory algorithms/concepts into a single interface that the user can interact with. The topics that were picked are Euler's Totient Function, Fast Modular Exponentiation, the Chinese Remainder Theorem, and Miller-Rabin's randomized primality testing algorithm. 
The user is not shown the details of each algorithm as each could be looked up online.
